This material also offers greater stiffness, durability and optimal vibration reduction after ball impact.\nComfortable hitting\nA detail to highlight is the incorporation of Nerve channels in the frame of this padel racket, which, when combined with the carbon, add superior stability, greater control and precision in the direction and control of the ball, as well as improved response and reaction time.\nIn the same way, the Bullpadel Hack 02 Performance padel racket incorporates the  Vibradrive system for effective vibration absorption, providing a comfortable feel in every stroke."

With this model, practice and play to become an elite professional. Play with a manageable racket, and in comfort.\nA racket designed in black and pink, with a marked pattern and a hollow heart to lighten the weight, which is approximately 360 grams and 38 mm thick. And a longer handle so that you can play holding the racket with 2 hands.\nTechnology researched by padel player Marta Marrero\nThis padel racket includes 2TB AIR technology. The structure of the racket is made with dual tubular technology instead of singular, to provide more resistance against impact and to reduce vibrations. And it is made with 80% carbon fibre.\nExperience a racket with a low balance, with a wider, central contact point. This is due to its round shape. The weight is distributed more towards the handle to provide you with more control of the racket, allowing for more accurate shots with energy and power.\n Resistant and soft materials to play comfortably\nThe racket has faces made with 3K aluminium fibre. These faces have less flexibility due to the number of fibre threads used, which enable you to hit the ball harder.\nThe padel racket also includes a premium quality EVA SC White rubber interior and three layers of Fibreglass. This softer rubber also helps you to execute better shots every time you make contact with the ball."

Therefore, this racket is designed with two layers of fibreglass, a layer of 3K Carbon and a Low Density PitonGlass, which is suitable for smashes or other attacking shots thanks to the semi-rigid feel it provides.\nIt is a versatile racket that will help you in any situation\nThis racket has a round shape with a large contact point, and is designed for play at the baseline,  which helps in off-centre shots, as it provides excellent control.\nThe legendary Piton 11 is a durable and very resistant racket thanks to its 2TB EVA frame, made with 80% carbon fibre, which makes the strike zone resistant and wider.\nIf what you are looking for is to execute more aggressive shots, but also be able to defend yourself on the court, the hard feel it provides is perfect for both, thanks to the 3XPly EVA. This consists of two layers of EVA rubber, one hard on the outside and a softer one on the interior of the racket.\nModern and unique\nLike its sister, the Piton 11 Soft, this racket also has a modern and vibrant design that is very attractive. It has an electric blue base colour, which draws attention and adds dynamism to your game. It combines the colour blue with black detailing, two colours that work perfectly together."

It adds solidity and stability when hitting the ball since this fabric reduces the vibrations produced by the impact of the ball.\nAlso, the faces have a shiny finish and a 3D design, which favors a better grip and a more complex ball trajectory, as well as the possibility of hitting with more spin."

The Holes Pattern System technology transmits power and precision in each stroke thanks to a more optimal distribution and size of the holes.\nAnd, also, the Vibrabsorb System technology absorbs the vibrations of the impacts thanks to the elastomer incorporated in the heart of the padel racket, which provides greater comfort and manages to prevent the player from possible arm injuries."

Designed for professional level padel players who enjoy printing power at the red, the Siux Fenix IV Pro is a diamond padel racket that allows you to be aggressive in attacking plays. Its diamond mold and high balance make it the perfect ally if you are looking for unstoppable and powerful shots, as well as high performance on the court. It weighs between 355 and 375 grams, which allows for comfortable handling and optimal freedom of movement due to its light weight. Vibration reduction On the other hand, it has been made with premium quality materials such as 18K Textreme 45º Carbon that make up the faces of this Siux padel racket. This material is highly resistant and durable. The planes have a glossy finish with 3D relief, which adds effect to the shots, as the ball grips more and spins with more speed. At the core we find EVA Hard rubber, a high density foam that provides superior control in the direction and placement of the ball. It also reduces vibration at impact. The tubular frame is made of 13K carbon + Aramid, which offers greater rigidity and resistance thanks to the strength and durability of the frame. It is a lightweight material, so it has a controlled weight. Natural grip In terms of technologies, it incorporates the Dampeners Shockout, a system that reduces the vibrations that occur after the impact of the ball, increasing the feeling of comfort and minimizing the possibility of injury. In the same way, the Dual Pro Grip has been included, a grip made of FOAM rubber that favors a more comfortable, natural and firm grip, which will help you to hit with firmness and stability at all times. In terms of aesthetics, it has been designed combining metallic and bright colors, which achieve a striking and attractive appearance."

        "description": "The Nox ML10 Bahia 12K Luxury, for reliability and robustness Nox collaborated with Miguel Lamperti to design this new racket for versatile players, the Nox ML10 Bahía 12K Luxury, which offers a great balance between control, precision, and power. Its teardrop shape gives it enormous power in attacking shots and good control in defense and returns. It weighs between 360 and 375 grams, which makes it easy and comfortable to handle. Intermediate touch If we focus on its composition, we can see that the faces of this Nox 2024 racket are made of 12K carbon, a rigid, durable, and resistant material that offers great precision when hitting and greater comfort thanks to reduced vibration after impact. They also feature a 3D texture that allows you to hit with spin. The core is made of EVA HR3 rubber, which offers power and control in a balanced way, to increase the versatility and adaptability of the padel player. In addition, it dampens vibrations and offers a good response on the volley. The frame is made of carbon, which provides rigidity and durability. Reduced vibrations When it comes to its technologies, it highlights the Pulse System, which consists of two elastomer bands inserted on both sides of the handle intended to optimally absorb vibrations to reduce fatigue and injuries. It also includes the Smartstrap, a pioneering safety strap system that offers greater reliability, confidence, and strength, which can be adjusted. It also features Dynamic Composite Structure technology, which increases the solidity of the outer parts, minimizing possible cuts in the fibers when the rubber sinks. As for its design, we can highlight a powerful aesthetic thanks to the combination of black, silver and red, which contrasts with the iridescent effect of the Nox logo, achieving modernity and style in every shot."

In addition, to reduce vibrations after an impact, the faces also incorporate Smart Holes System technology, in which the distribution of the holes is strategically placed to ensure stability and comfort.\nWith the same objective, the Cork Cushion Grip system and the Silicone Grip Channel have been incorporated, two technologies that absorb vibrations in an optimal way through a cork laminate on the handle."

The carbon fabrics are imbued with resin and provide greater durability, homogeneity, and rigidity to each shot. This technology considerably improves the torsion and resistance of the racket structure.\nFor the heart of this racket, EVA Soft rubber has been chosen as the main material, a light and elastic rubber that achieves more comfort and power in the game.

The diamond shape gives the racquet extraordinary power by having a higher contact point, which is especially useful for attacking shots such as smashes. Its weight of between 360 and 375 grams makes it easy to handle. Its design is powerful and modern. Stability and reliability In terms of composition, the ML10 Shotgun 18K has the same mix of material as previous models. In the inner core we find the Black EVA HR3 high-density rubber which provides great power and a spectacular spin. Additionally, the surface is made of 18K carbon, a highly rigid and resistant material which provides lightness due to the fact that it is composed of fine, interwoven carbon microfilaments. What’s more, the roughness of the faces allows the player to hit with more spin. The frame is also made of carbon, combining durability, control, power, and lightness in every shot. It reduces excessive arm fatigue and provides greater comfort during play. Outstanding power and control If we take a look at the technologies it incorporates, we can highlight the Pulse System which reduces vibrations after impact thanks to the embedded lateral rubber. It also includes the Dynamic Composite Structure which unifies the hardness level of the frame and face to prevent cracking on the outside. Likewise, thanks to the Smartstrap, you will be able to smoothly adjust the safety strap."

        "description": "Adidas X-Treme LTD Black/Gold, ideal for expert players.\nThe Adidas X-Treme LTD Black/Gold padel racket has been designed for those players with an advanced or expert level who are looking for a racket that helps them reach their maximum level in every match. It has a weight between 345 and 375 grams.\nIt presents a round shape with a low balance, so it is ideal if you want to get a plus of control in each stroke, since, by distributing the weight towards the fist area, the manageability will be excellent and the strokes will feel firmer, comfortable and safe. In addition, it has a large sweet spot and centered(Sweet Spot Center), which will provide more precision and will allow to return more balls to the opposite field, since the good hitting area is larger.\nAs for the design, we can highlight the elegance that is transmitted with the combination of black and gold colors. The aesthetics are modern and visually attractive.\nMore maneuverability and spin when hitting\nInside this Adidas model we find the EVA Soft Performance rubber, a low density foam that offers great comfort and a ball output with a lot of momentum and efficiency. Due to its low density, its strong point is the comfort it provides to the player.\nThe planes, on the other hand, are made of fiberglass. This fabric confers elasticity, balance, flexibility, a softer feel and a higher ball output. You will be able to return the most difficult balls, even from the back of the court.\nIn addition, the finish is matte and rough, so the ball will grip more easily to the faces and spin with more effect.\nAlso, the Adidas X-Treme LTD Black/Gold padel racket incorporates the Smart Holes Curve technology, which combined with the rough texture, will increase manageability and allow the player to hit with more spin thanks to the distribution of the holes.\nOn the other hand, it also incorporates the Structural Reinforcement technology, perimeter reinforcements that are responsible for increasing the resistance of the padel racket to the high torsions that can suffer during a match."

There are also details in yellow which achieve a striking and attractive aesthetic. It belongs to the ONE range and has a weight that ranges from 345 grams to 370 grams. It is a very light and manageable racket.\nPrioritise power over control\nThis model incorporates AERODYNAMIC DRILLING technology, a drilling system, which is responsible for eliminating vibrations after impacts, achieving a resistant and homogeneous racket. This increases the contact point of the racket, which achieves greater spin, control and power.\nIn addition, it includes HANDLESAFETY technology, a safety system located in the handle that achieves a more snug grip for the player, providing a 100% safe and comfortable grip. This is achieved thanks to the fact that the strap passes through the sides of the handle, and therefore is on the sides of the racket.\nHowever, the most remarkable technology of this Varlion racket is that of the HEXAGON frame, which turns the racket into a resistant and rigid tool.\nSmooth, glossy finish\nThe interior of the racket is composed of medium soft HYPERMEDIUM rubber foam, with a low hardness. The core is laminated with three layers of fibreglass, which have been coated with VAR-FLEX epoxy resin, which gives it greater elasticity and resistance.\nThe surface is made with fibreglass as the main material and offers a soft touch, as well as great spin, especially from the baseline."

It weighs between 355 and 375 grams, making it a highly manageable and comfortable racket to use.Its shape is round with a low balance, that is, the weight is distributed more towards the handle and that facilitates a controlled grip and shots, thanks to the magnificent mobility it offers at all times. The contact point of this racket is wide, which implies greater precision and a greater number of balls successfully returned, since the optimal surface to hit the ball is larger.High quality materialsAt the core we find a low-density EVA Soft rubber, a rubber that adds durability to the racket, provides more control in slow shots and more power in offensive shots. This type of rubber offers a softer feel and an ideal rebound.In turn, the faces of the Tsunami Revolution are made of 3K carbon and have a matte finish. Siux classifies carbon fibres differently, therefore 3K carbon is the hardest carbon. This translates into greater spin, even from the back of the court, and more resistance and power.The tubular frame is made of fibreglass and carbon, which adds durability and lightness to the racket.Avoid wrist, shoulder and elbow injuriesThis model, like all the rackets of the new 2023 season, has ShockOut anti-vibration, which considerably improves the performance of the racket while protecting the player from possible injuries. In addition, thanks to the Reinforced Bridge technology, the heart of this Siux 2023 racket is reinforced."

And, although it will not have the same efficiency as with a rough padel racket, the player will also be able to hit with a bit of spin on sliced or lifted shots.\nIn addition, the inner core is made of EVA Soft rubber, a high-density foam that absorbs the vibrations produced by the impact of the ball for a softer and more comfortable feel.
