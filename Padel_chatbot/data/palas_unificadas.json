It has a diamond shape, a high balance and a weight of 365 grams. This shape allows for powerful and comfortable shots, since, by distributing the weight towards the head, it achieves lethal attacking shots. Technical Veron 2024, excellent quality The core combines 3 layers of EVA rubber of different densities, a softer inner layer that provides comfort and tolerance and two outer layers that add power to each stroke thanks to greater rigidity. The planes, on the other hand, have been manufactured with Carbon Flex, a fabric that combines fiberglass and carbon fiber to achieve a much more flexible surface, which provides unprecedented dynamic power. Enjoy great performance on the track If we focus on technologies, it is worth mentioning the 3D Spin+, reliefs located on the faces of this Babolat 2024 padel racket that allow the player to hit the ball with much more control and effect. It also incorporates a system that allows the removal of the strap, so that the athlete can wash it or change it according to their needs. On the other hand, it has the Vibrabsorb System by SMAC, a technology that increases control and improves the sensations during the stroke, since it absorbs the vibrations produced after the impact of the ball. This is achieved with the combination of elastomers integrated into the carbon fibers of the core. It also integrates the Holes Pattern System, which favors the transmission of power in the return of the blows by optimizing the size and distribution of the dies of the padel racket.",

For this reason, we bring to you the new line of the HEAD brand, the SPEED range’s new collection. Within this category, the lightest racket is the SPEED MOTION 2023.\nThe new SPEED MOTION 2023 racket is a super versatile and very manageable racket that offers you a high-speed game. With this teardrop-shaped racket with an intermediate balance, players of a more advanced level will be able to play much faster and achieve a dynamic game.\nEndorsed by the professional player Ariana Sánchez, on the outside of the SPEED MOTION 2023, we find a hybrid hitting area made of carbon and fibreglass. On the other hand, the inner core of the racket features Power Foam rubber, which provides you with speed and power in each shot.\nYou will gain power as well as control with the new HEAD SPEED MOTION 2023\nWhen talking about the technologies that this magnificent racket includes, it is inevitable to mention the main one featured in this racket, Auxetic technology, which provides a better feeling of impact and also much more power when hitting.\nA good material to use inside the racket is graphene, which is why the frame has been reinforced with Graphene Inside, offering the player more stability, but also the possibility of optimising the transfer of energy that reaches the ball through the racket.\nAnother important detail is that Anti Shock Skin technology has been placed on the IBS2 (Integrated Bumper System 2) integrated protector. This is a high-quality polymer sheet that protects the racket from any blows and scratches to which it may be exposed during a match. Also, a new soft butt cap has been added to the handle that improves the feel by making it softer.",

Due to its light weight, ranging from 345 to 360 grams, this Adidas 2024 padel racket is ideal for players who prioritize easy handling and quick, agile movements. If we focus on its shape, we can highlight its round shape, with a centered sweet spot and low balance. These features provide the beginner player with superb control for firm, confident strokes. You will shine in the defensive game. Comfort and speed In terms of materials, it should be noted that the core includes EVA Soft Performance rubber, a low density foam that provides a fast and powerful ball output. In addition, in low-speed shots, the player will be able to hit the ball efficiently and with good momentum. Also, fiberglass is present both in the frame of the padel racket and in the faces. This material is highly flexible, so if the padel racket receives the impact of the ball in a static position or at low speed, a greater rebound will be achieved and the ball will come out faster with less effort. Areas vulnerable to twisting with extra reinforcement And, if we focus on technologies, we must mention the Smart Holes Linear, which is responsible for increasing the durability of the padel racket by reinforcing the areas of greater torsion through an arrangement of equidistant in groups of 3. On the other hand, it also incorporates the Structural Reinforcement, which consists of perimeter reinforcements placed throughout the padel racket in order to increase resistance to high torsion.",

It has a rounded shape with a low balance, that is, the weight is distributed towards the wrist area, so that excellent control is achieved in each stroke. In addition, its wide sweet spot and centering makes it easy to hit. It weighs between 360 and 375 grams and has a surface area of 519 cm2. As for its design, a color scheme in nude tones has been used, combining brown details with the off-white of the padel racket's body. It is a simple and vintage aesthetic, as its name indicates. Greater resistance to shocks The frame is made of fiberglass, a very flexible and durable material with great responsiveness and vibration absorption, which provides unbeatable comfort. It guarantees easy and controlled handling. The flats, on the other hand, are also made of fiberglass, so when the padel racket is in a static position or in those low-speed shots, the rubber will work harder and a greater rebound will be achieved with minimum effort. Reinforced areas of increased torsion Also, this Adidas 2024 padel racket incorporates durability technologies, which are responsible for increasing the resistance of the padel racket against high torsion to extend its life. We note the Smart Holes Linear, which consists of an arrangement of the holes of the planes in groups of 3. That gets the surface is reinforced and durability increases. On the other hand, we find the Structural Reinforcement, a system that generates more resistance to the torsions suffered by the padel racket during the match through the use of perimeter reinforcements throughout the padel racket.",

Therefore, this racket is designed with two layers of fibreglass, a layer of 3K Carbon and a Low Density PitonGlass, which is suitable for smashes or other attacking shots thanks to the semi-rigid feel it provides.\nIt is a versatile racket that will help you in any situation\nThis racket has a round shape with a large contact point, and is designed for play at the baseline,  which helps in off-centre shots, as it provides excellent control.\nThe legendary Piton 11 is a durable and very resistant racket thanks to its 2TB EVA frame, made with 80% carbon fibre, which makes the strike zone resistant and wider.\nIf what you are looking for is to execute more aggressive shots, but also be able to defend yourself on the court, the hard feel it provides is perfect for both, thanks to the 3XPly EVA. This consists of two layers of EVA rubber, one hard on the outside and a softer one on the interior of the racket.\nModern and unique\nLike its sister, the Piton 11 Soft, this racket also has a modern and vibrant design that is very attractive. It has an electric blue base colour, which draws attention and adds dynamism to your game. It combines the colour blue with black detailing, two colours that work perfectly together.",

In addition, the recommended grip is the Syntec Uptake.\nThis padel racket will provide you with comfort and power like no other.\nIn addition, it incorporates the 3D Spin technology, which seeks to give the player access to more spin on the ball during the game and can more easily surprise his opponent.

The Holes Pattern System technology transmits power and precision in each stroke thanks to a more optimal distribution and size of the holes.\nAnd, also, the Vibrabsorb System technology absorbs the vibrations of the impacts thanks to the elastomer incorporated in the heart of the padel racket, which provides greater comfort and manages to prevent the player from possible arm injuries.",

Its teardrop shape gives it enormous power in attacking shots and good control in defense and returns. It weighs between 360 and 375 grams, which makes it easy and comfortable to handle. Intermediate touch If we focus on its composition, we can see that the faces of this Nox 2024 racket are made of 12K carbon, a rigid, durable, and resistant material that offers great precision when hitting and greater comfort thanks to reduced vibration after impact. They also feature a 3D texture that allows you to hit with spin. The core is made of EVA HR3 rubber, which offers power and control in a balanced way, to increase the versatility and adaptability of the padel player. In addition, it dampens vibrations and offers a good response on the volley. The frame is made of carbon, which provides rigidity and durability. Reduced vibrations When it comes to its technologies, it highlights the Pulse System, which consists of two elastomer bands inserted on both sides of the handle intended to optimally absorb vibrations to reduce fatigue and injuries. It also includes the Smartstrap, a pioneering safety strap system that offers greater reliability, confidence, and strength, which can be adjusted. It also features Dynamic Composite Structure technology, which increases the solidity of the outer parts, minimizing possible cuts in the fibers when the rubber sinks. As for its design, we can highlight a powerful aesthetic thanks to the combination of black, silver and red, which contrasts with the iridescent effect of the Nox logo, achieving modernity and style in every shot.",

This type of format has a very wide contact point, which facilitates greater precision and dexterity when hitting the ball. You will not have to give up great control for greater power.\nIt has a particular design since the surface is iridescent, that is, the color changes depending on the light it receives thanks to the LOOK technology. A striking, elegant, and innovative aesthetic is achieved.\nHigh-end manufacturing\nThe faces of the Delta 2.0 are made of Carbon 3000, a carbon of three thousand monofilaments that gives a firm and uniform hit thanks to the stable rigidity that it contributes to the faces of the racket.\nIn addition, the diamond-shaped surface has a rough 3D texture that gives the ball a rotating effect, ideal for more aggressive games.\nThe Twin Tubular system has been incorporated into the double tubular frame. The carbon fabrics are imbued with resin and provide greater durability, homogeneity, and rigidity to each shot. This technology considerably improves the torsion and resistance of the racket structure.\nFor the heart of this racket, EVA Soft rubber has been chosen as the main material, a light and elastic rubber that achieves more comfort and power in the game. In addition, it offers a better finish and great absorption of vibrations.\nExclusive technologies from the Ambition Pro range\nThis model has high-performance technologies such as the Smart Holes System, a curved hole system which facilitates the achievement of spin as well as improving the reduction of vibrations.\nTwo other technologies that need to be highlighted are the Cork Cushion Grip and the Silicone Grip Channel, both located in the handle or grip area and focused on eliminating vibrations and the consequent reduction of injuries to the player's arm.",

The diamond shape gives the racquet extraordinary power by having a higher contact point, which is especially useful for attacking shots such as smashes. Its weight of between 360 and 375 grams makes it easy to handle. Its design is powerful and modern. Stability and reliability In terms of composition, the ML10 Shotgun 18K has the same mix of material as previous models. In the inner core we find the Black EVA HR3 high-density rubber which provides great power and a spectacular spin. Additionally, the surface is made of 18K carbon, a highly rigid and resistant material which provides lightness due to the fact that it is composed of fine, interwoven carbon microfilaments. What’s more, the roughness of the faces allows the player to hit with more spin. The frame is also made of carbon, combining durability, control, power, and lightness in every shot. It reduces excessive arm fatigue and provides greater comfort during play. Outstanding power and control If we take a look at the technologies it incorporates, we can highlight the Pulse System which reduces vibrations after impact thanks to the embedded lateral rubber. It also includes the Dynamic Composite Structure which unifies the hardness level of the frame and face to prevent cracking on the outside. Likewise, thanks to the Smartstrap, you will be able to smoothly adjust the safety strap.",

        "description": "Varlion Bourne One 2023, a racket to get started in the world of padel\nThe Varlion Bourne One padel racket has been designed with beginner players in mind who have very little experience and technique in padel. It has a diamond shape, with a medium-high balance and offers unparalleled power, especially on key shots such as the smash.\nOn the other hand, we observe that the Varlion Bourne One 2023 racket has a modern design, which mixes the black of the faces with the bronze colour of the frame and heart. There are also details in yellow which achieve a striking and attractive aesthetic. It belongs to the ONE range and has a weight that ranges from 345 grams to 370 grams. It is a very light and manageable racket.\nPrioritise power over control\nThis model incorporates AERODYNAMIC DRILLING technology, a drilling system, which is responsible for eliminating vibrations after impacts, achieving a resistant and homogeneous racket. This increases the contact point of the racket, which achieves greater spin, control and power.\nIn addition, it includes HANDLESAFETY technology, a safety system located in the handle that achieves a more snug grip for the player, providing a 100% safe and comfortable grip. This is achieved thanks to the fact that the strap passes through the sides of the handle, and therefore is on the sides of the racket.\nHowever, the most remarkable technology of this Varlion racket is that of the HEXAGON frame, which turns the racket into a resistant and rigid tool.\nSmooth, glossy finish\nThe interior of the racket is composed of medium soft HYPERMEDIUM rubber foam, with a low hardness. The core is laminated with three layers of fibreglass, which have been coated with VAR-FLEX epoxy resin, which gives it greater elasticity and resistance.\nThe surface is made with fibreglass as the main material and offers a soft touch, as well as great spin, especially from the baseline.",

The contact point of this racket is wide, which implies greater precision and a greater number of balls successfully returned, since the optimal surface to hit the ball is larger.High quality materialsAt the core we find a low-density EVA Soft rubber, a rubber that adds durability to the racket, provides more control in slow shots and more power in offensive shots. This type of rubber offers a softer feel and an ideal rebound.In turn, the faces of the Tsunami Revolution are made of 3K carbon and have a matte finish. Siux classifies carbon fibres differently, therefore 3K carbon is the hardest carbon. This translates into greater spin, even from the back of the court, and more resistance and power.The tubular frame is made of fibreglass and carbon, which adds durability and lightness to the racket.Avoid wrist, shoulder and elbow injuriesThis model, like all the rackets of the new 2023 season, has ShockOut anti-vibration, which considerably improves the performance of the racket while protecting the player from possible injuries. In addition, thanks to the Reinforced Bridge technology, the heart of this Siux 2023 racket is reinforced.",

This type of rubber offers a softer feel and an ideal rebound.In turn, the faces of the Tsunami Revolution are made of 3K carbon and have a matte finish. Siux classifies carbon fibres differently, therefore 3K carbon is the hardest carbon. This translates into greater spin, even from the back of the court, and more resistance and power.The tubular frame is made of fibreglass and carbon, which adds durability and lightness to the racket.Avoid wrist, shoulder and elbow injuriesThis model, like all the rackets of the new 2023 season, has ShockOut anti-vibration, which considerably improves the performance of the racket while protecting the player from possible injuries.

This shape has a reduced contact point and is slightly displaced towards the head. It offers you exceptional power on offensive shots like the smash.\nIncreases the spin on the ball\nThe core of this Varlion model is HYPERSOFT, a foam rubber with medium hardness, which offers balanced control and power, as well as very good spin. This rubber is softer and it is recommended to use it in temperatures below 25ºC.\n12K carbon fibre is the main material used in the manufacture of the outer part of this men’s padel racket. This fabric (7 RHOMBUS CARBON FABRIC) has a rhomboid shape and provides flexibility to the core. \nIn the Bourne Prisma Airflow by Varlion we find a prism frame, which resists the wind 10% less, offers great handling and more speed of play and movement of the racket. This frame, which is more rigid and resistant, has an adhesive protectorattached to it, which eliminates vibrations and absorbs shocks and abrasions.\nInnovation and high performance technologies\nWhat’s more, this racket includes DIFFUSOR WINGS technology, which guarantees more control when hitting thanks to the elimination of vibrations, more speed and a more consistent and regular ball trajectory.\nThe SLICE technology provides roughness to the faces of this racket, achieving more spin in the shots since the ball grips the surface more easily. It is a technology that has been designed especially with drive shots with slices or backhand shots in mind.",

The winter version of the Bourne Prisma Radio W incorporates materials with greater mechanical elasticity so that, when temperatures are below 25ºC, you can perform well on the court.\nThe surface has a rough texture, which allows for a better grip on the ball and, therefore, it will be able to achieve more spin and surprise the opponent more easily.\nThe core, meanwhile, is made of HYPERSOFT foam rubber of medium hardness, which provides exceptional rebounding and a balance between power and control.\nThe frame of the Bourne Prisma Radio W has been designed in the shape of a prism and offers the player great handling and speed, as well as greater velocity of play and movement of the racket.\nTake your game to the next level\nThis Varlion model incorporates a wide variety of technologies that make it a complete and high-performance racket.\nAmong them we can highlight one of the most important, RADIO, a very innovative technology that has revolutionised the manufacturing process of padel rackets. This is so because the racket comes out of its own mould, so the core is much more resistant and the use of fabrics has been reduced by 50%.\nWe also find AIRFLOW technology, which focuses on providing airflow through a special arrangement of elongated, circular holes located in the centre of the core and around the frame. This helps the player to get much more power in each shot.",
